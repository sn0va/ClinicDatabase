Clinic Database
Sean Novak

This project simulates the possible function of a clinic scheduling and database program. The program is able to store a
variety of data about the doctors, nurses, patients and appointments associated with the clinic. The main purpose of this
program was to be object-oriented, as such classes were used for as much as possible. All the the data associated with
the clinic is stored as .txt files in the "object data" file, and the program is capable of reading extracting data from
and manipulating the files if another instance is opened later. I have only tested this program with the Visual Studio
debugger. The Clinic Database was team project completed by myself and two other students for CS 142.
